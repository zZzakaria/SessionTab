# SessionTab

SessionTab is a chrome extension built to help you manage your open tabs. 

### Motivation

I always find myself in front of an excessive amount of open tabs and windows. The way I structure my browsing sessions is by keeping relevant tabs under a specific window. Whatever I do, I usually keep at least 2 windows open, one for miscellaneous tabs (social media, music, netflix, etc.), and another one for a specific task I am doing. I am not sure about you, but personally, I almost never work on a task until completion. Most of the time, I interleave tasks. For example, one day I could be working on a programming project and having tabs open for docs, for stackoverflow, github issues, etc. Then the following day, I find myself working on a course assignment or reviewing for an exam. The result is 3 windows open with a ton of tabs in each. I don't like to close the window because I don't want to lose my "browsing progress". 

One solution is using bookmarks to save all open tabs in different windows. This could work, however, i'm not a big fan of chrome bookmarks. I always get lost trying to find, add, or deleting bookmarks. In addition, I wanted to be **only** a few clicks away from "saving" and "retrieving" my sessions.

I briefly looked for a chrome extension online, but most of them were too complicated for what I needed, so I created an opportunity to build my own chrome extension. 

A chrome extension easily hooks into the browsing experience. It wouldn't require me to open a new window, which makes the experience smoother. 

This extension was built with React, emotion, reach-ui, and formik.

## Installation

If you wish to play around with the source code, simply download or `git clone` the repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:zakariaelas/SessionTab.git
cd SessionTab
yarn install
```
Once you finish hacking, you should run the following command:
```
yarn build
```

6. Start Saving!

- The top right button icon is used to create a new **group**. A group is simply a collection of tabs.

- Group added! The "X" button icon on the right can be used to remove tabs in a group.

- The three dots open a menu. You can either open all the tabs of a group in a separate window, edit a group (change the name or bulk edit the tabs), or remove a group.

- If you try to remove a group, you get a confirmation dialog to avoid deleting a group mistakenly.

That's it. It's definitely not the most impressive chrome extension you'll come across, but it's simple and does the job **quickly**. If it solved my problem, it might solve yours.
